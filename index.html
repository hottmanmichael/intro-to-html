      <h3>Cities I have lived in...</h3>
      <p>
         I was born and raised in Fort Collins and lived there until I graduated
         high school. After high school I spent a gap year in Bremen, Germany.
         When I returned I lived in Fort Collins again to attend CSU and upon graduating
         I got a job in Denver and moved there. Now I am back in Fort Collins once again.

      <h3>Cities I would like to visit...</h3>
      <p>
         Ha Long Bay in Vietnam looks like an incredibly beautiful place. My parents
         were able to visit there several years ago and raved about not only the
         sights, but also the city, the food, and the people. I have heard many great
         things about Bangkok in regards to ease of travel, the people, and the food
         and have spoken with many people who say Thailand is their favorite place
         in the world. Sao Paulo because I have many friends who live in or around
         the city and I have also heard amazing things about the food and sights
         in Brazil.
