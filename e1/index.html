         <h3>Cities I have lived in...</h3>
         <p>
            I was born and raised in Fort Collins and lived there until I graduated
            high school. After high school I spent a gap year in Bremen, Germany.
            When I returned I lived in Fort Collins again to attend CSU and upon graduating
            I got a job in Denver and moved there. Now I am back in Fort Collins once again.

         <h3>Cities I would like to visit...</h3>
         <p>
            Ha Long Bay in Vietnam looks like an incredibly beautiful place. My parents
            were able to visit there several years ago and raved about not only the
            sights, but also the city, the food, and the people. I have heard many great
            things about Bangkok in regards to ease of travel, the people, and the food
            and have spoken with many people who say Thailand is their favorite place
            in the world. Sao Paulo because I have many friends who live in or around
            the city and I have also heard amazing things about the food and sights
            in Brazil.
